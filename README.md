## Description
Connect Four (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, Four in a Line, Drop Four, and Gravitrips (in Soviet Union)) is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.  


## Origins
It is not clear exactly when the first Four in a Row game appeared.

The earliest claimed ancestry is a legend surrounding early explorer Captain Cook. Authors have spent some time investigating the veracity of this but have found no hard and fast evidence. The first appearance of the story found so far is on a version of the game called Captain's Mistress sold by North West Corner of Washington copyrighted in 1987. This company produced several historic games that have since been copied - a copy of the Captain's Mistress game was produced by British company Nauticalia for some years. On both versions it is stated that Captain Cook spent so much time stuck in his cabin playing the game against his fellow travellers naturalist Joseph Banks and botanist Daniel Solander on his voyages that it become known as the Captain's Mistress. Whether this was just a sales-led invention or if perhaps there is a grain of truth in it remains to be seen.

More certain is that Milton Bradley (now Hasbro) started selling their massively successful version of the game called Connect 4 in February 1974 (1976 in Britain).

But the game has certainly been around for much longer than that. In a book by Robbie Bell, there is a picture of a 4 in a row game that he calls "Four Balls". It is a wooden game made to exactly the same design as the Northwest Corner game earlier mentioned - the implication being that Northwest corner copied an earlier version. This is a higher quality example though being made from Mahogany with beech balls for pieces. Bell says that the date of the game is uncertain but he estimates that it is Edwardian c. 1901 - 1910. On the bottom of the game in gold lettering is inscribed "Remy Martin Cognac".
